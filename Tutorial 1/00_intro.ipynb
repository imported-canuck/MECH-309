    "# This is the First Tutorial of MECH309\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aim of the tutorial\n",
    "This tutorial aims to recapitulate on some of the python basics you have learned already in COMP208.\n",
    "Most of the things should be already be known to you, and it just adds some things that will be helpfull for understanding code snippets in MECH309 and help you to score good grades in the assessments of MECH309.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hendrik Nicolai acknowledges James Richard Forbes (McGill) for providing materials.\n",
    "Part of these examples are taken from his repository (https://github.com/jrforbes/mech_309_code)."

    "## Set up your Python environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any Python editor you like (e.g., Vim, Emacs, Spyder, etc.). There are many excellent options available.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have personally used Emacs for many years, but the strong ecosystem and ease of use of Visual Studio Code recently convinced me to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven’t chosen an editor yet, I recommend starting with **VS Code**, as it is beginner-friendly and well supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up Python on your machine (short reminder)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are very brief, high-level hints for setting up a Python environment.  \n",
    "You do **not** need a perfect setup—just something that lets you run Python scripts and install packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux\n",
    "Most Linux distributions already come with Python installed.  \n",
    "You can usually verify this by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "If needed, install Python and pip using your package manager (e.g. apt, dnf, pacman).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### macOS\n",
    "The recommended approach is to install Python via a package manager such as Homebrew.\n",
    "Once Homebrew is installed, Python can be installed with:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Windows\n",
    "I do not actively use Windows.\n",
    "If you have not set up Python yet, the easiest and most robust solution is to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and follow the Linux instructions above :D\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package environment\n",
    "One of the biggest advantages of Python is its rich and well-maintained ecosystem of packages and libraries.  \n",
    "The main downside is that managing these packages can sometimes become cumbersome, especially when different projects require different versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with its own package manager, **`pip`**, which works well—particularly when used together with **virtual environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another option, which I personally recommend, is **Miniforge3**. It provides a lightweight Conda-based environment similar to Anaconda, but without unnecessary extras, and it uses the **conda-forge** channel by default. \n",
    "This often results in more reliable and consistent package installations, especially for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Python packages\n",
    "For this course, we will mainly rely on the following core scientific Python packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy** – efficient array operations, linear algebra, and numerical computations  \n",
    "- **SciPy** – numerical algorithms such as solvers, optimization, integration, and interpolation  \n",
    "- **Matplotlib** – plotting and visualization of results  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these packages form the foundation of the scientific Python ecosystem and are sufficient for all assignments and projects in this course.\n"

    "### `.py` vs `.ipynb`\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code can be written either as plain script files (`.py`) or as Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`).  \n",
    "Both formats are useful, but they serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`.py` files**\n",
    "- Best for clean, reproducible code\n",
    "- Easy to version control (Git)\n",
    "- Suitable for larger projects and scripts\n",
    "- Less interactive for exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**`.ipynb` files (Jupyter notebooks)**\n",
    "- Excellent for exploration, learning, and visualization\n",
    "- Combine code, text, equations, and plots in one place\n",
    "- Very convenient for tutorials and reports\n",
    "- Harder to version control cleanly\n",
    "- Execution order can be confusing if cells are run out of order\n",
    "- Additional packages for `.ipynb` files: `jupyter` and `ipykernel`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**  \n",
    "Use **Jupyter notebooks** for learning, experimentation, and visualization, and switch to **`.py` files** once the code becomes larger or more structured."
